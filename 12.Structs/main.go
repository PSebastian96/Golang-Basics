A struct (short for structure) is a user-defined type that allows you to group variables of different types
into a single unit.

Think of it as a blueprint for creating complex data models â€” like a record, object, or class without methods.

	Feature 		| Explanation
	Value Type 		| Structs are value types (copied on assign)
