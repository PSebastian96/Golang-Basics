A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
Think of it like a signpost ðŸª§ pointing to where the value is stored, rather than holding the value itself.

p := &x -> p now holds the address of x

Dereferencing: * to access the value at the pointer's address

	Key Takeaways:
	1 Pointers store memory addresses, enabling direct access to data.
	2 Use & to get an address and * to access the value at that address.
	3 Nil pointers represent uninitialized pointers.

	Use Case 							| Why it Matters
	Modify a variable inside a function | Pass its pointer so you can change it
	Efficiently handle large structs 	| Pass by reference instead of copying
	Shared state 						| Multiple parts of code can modify same var
